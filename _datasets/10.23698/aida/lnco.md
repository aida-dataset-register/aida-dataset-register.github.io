    Lymph nodes manually classified into two groups, either with or without
    tumor metastases. Tumors have been non-exhaustively annotated in lymph nodes
    that have them, so only lymph nodes without tumor present can be reliably
    used as examples of normal tissue. Regions deemed not suitable for AI
    training have been annotated for exclusion (eg missing or poor quality
    material), or as preparation artefact (eg folded tissue sample).

    Note: Data collection is still ongoing &ndash; not all samples have yet been
    classified.
